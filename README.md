# Graph Data Structure in C++

Implementation of a graph data structure in C++. It provides a flexible and efficient way to represent and work with graphs in your C++ programs.

## Features

- Directed and undirected graphs: The graph implementation supports both directed and undirected graphs. You can easily create and manipulate graphs with different edge orientations.
- Edge operations: The graph provides methods for adding edges.
- Traversal algorithms: The implementation includes popular graph traversal algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS), which can be used to explore and analyze the graph.
